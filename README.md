## General Information
- The task involves utilizing 42's graphical library, MiniLibX, which provides fundamental tools for creating images, opening windows, and handling different keyboard and mouse events.
-  By building fract-ol I had the chance to gain familiarity with MiniLibX, explore the mathematical concept of complex numbers and delve into optimization in computer graphics.


## Features
- Creating both Mandelbrot and Julia sets
- Possibility to provide different c numbers for Julia sets 
- Customizing different color shemes, black and white, hue saturated value, green.
